## Thanks

A big thank you to [1tilen](https://github.com/1tilen/Anytone_HAM_SLO) for the original codeplug. 
I have upgraded it by adding repeaters close to the Italian border, adding scan lists, and exporting it using a higher version of AnyTone CPS.

Feel free to check out their work for additional insights and configurations.
